# Module-2-VBA-Scripting
Repo for homework submission task 2 for Data Analytics Bootcamp
The more I seemed to work on this assignment the worse my code seemed to be and I hit a point where I could no longer progress any further.

The main issue I encountered was that I could never get the code to run smoothly and loop through all the sheets together, it seemed to be either one or the other. 
Second big issue I found was that when I went to transfer my code to the main spreadsheet and not the test sheet, I encounted overflow issues and runtime issues which I have now ran out of time to rectify. I think this is due to the amount of rows exceeding the limit of 32 767 values, to correct this I would declare my lastrow variable as a Long but this still didn't work. 

I hope to get some feedback regarding the code as I am really interested to know where I have gone wrong. I dont want this assignment to defeat me!

My screen shots are from the test spreadsheet as this was the only sheet I could get my code to work on with the issues I mentioned above.
